# Screen-API

This is an API made with spigot for the sandbox-game minecraft. It allows us to change a player's screen to whatever we want.

It has 144 different colors to work with and has support for drawing pixels, text and images. The screen is a map display of 12 by 7 equal to a reolution of 1532:896 which means that there are 1 376 256 pixels.

This API makes it possible to create images, animations and even minigames without being limited to the minecraft rendering.

If you need anything added to this API create an issue or if you have the code already create an pull request.
